            <h2 id="policy-4">4. Disclosure and Sharing of Information</h2>
            <p>OnClick Infotech does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. However, in some
                cases, we may share limited data with trusted service providers or third-party partners who assist us in
                delivering specific parts of our services—such as cloud storage providers, email hosting services,
                analytics platforms, or payment gateways. We only work with vendors that uphold data security and
                confidentiality, and we ensure that they use your information solely for the purposes we authorize.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may also disclose information if required by law, in response to legal requests, or if we believe in
                good faith that such action is necessary to protect our rights, the safety of our clients, or to
                investigate potential violations of our terms and policies.
            </p>


            <h2 id="policy-5">5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>

            <p>Like most modern websites, we use cookies and similar tracking technologies to provide a smoother user
                experience, remember your preferences, and gather analytics about how visitors interact with our site.
                These technologies help us understand user behavior, identify pages that are most or least useful, and
                ultimately improve the way our website functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can choose to accept or decline cookies through your browser settings. Please note that disabling
                cookies may affect the functionality and user experience of our website.

            <h2 id="policy-6">6. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We take data security very seriously and implement a combination of technical, administrative, and
                physical safeguards to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, misuse, or loss. Our
                internal practices follow industry standards to secure both digital and physical access to sensitive
                information. However, while we make every reasonable effort to protect your data, it’s important to
                understand that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100%
                secure, and therefore we cannot guarantee absolute security.
            </p>


            <h2 id="policy-7">7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

            <p>Depending on where you reside, you may have certain rights under data protection laws, such as the right
                to access the information we hold about you, request corrections, or ask us to delete your data
                entirely. You may also have the right to object to or limit certain types of processing and to withdraw
                any consent you’ve previously given us (such as for marketing emails).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you would like to make a request regarding your personal data or have any concerns about how we use
                it, please contact us directly using the information provided below.

            </p>

                practices or content of those external platforms. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any
                third-party websites you visit.
            </p>


            <h2 id="policy-9">9. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our services and website are not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly
                collect personal information from individuals in this age group. If we become aware that we have
                inadvertently gathered data from a child without parental consent, we will take immediate steps to
