            <h2 id="policy-1">1. Overview of Services</h2>
            <p>OnClick Infotech offers a diverse range of digital solutions, including but not limited to website
                development, mobile and web application development, artificial intelligence and machine learning
                services, digital marketing, software development, UI/UX design, cloud infrastructure, and other custom
                IT services. All services are provided under specific agreements, project proposals, or contracts, which
                may include timelines, pricing, deliverables, and other important details.</p>

            <h2 id="policy-2">2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By using our website or engaging in any business communication with OnClick Infotech—whether via a
                contact form, direct email, or service request—you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to
                be legally bound by these Terms of Service, as well as our Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h2 id="policy-3">3. Use of Website</h2>
            <p>You agree to use our website only for lawful purposes and in a way that does not infringe upon the rights
                of others, restrict or inhibit their use of the site, or breach any applicable local, national, or
                international law.</p>
            <p>You may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems, introduce malicious code, or interfere
                with the functionality of the website. Any misuse may result in access restrictions, legal action, or
                both.</p>

            <h2 id="policy-4">4. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
            <p>Unless otherwise stated, all content on this website—including text, graphics, logos, icons, service
                descriptions, software code, and design elements—is the property of OnClick Infotech or its licensors,
                and is protected under copyright, trademark, and intellectual property laws.</p>
            <p>You may not reproduce, distribute, modify, or create derivative works from any content without explicit
                written permission from OnClick Infotech. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property is strictly
                prohibited and may result in legal consequences.</p>

            <h2 id="policy-5">5. Service Agreements and Deliverables</h2>
            <p>Any professional engagement, project development, or custom solution will be governed by a mutually
                agreed-upon service contract or proposal. This agreement will define the scope of work, timelines,
                payment terms, revision policies, and other responsibilities. Once accepted, both parties are expected
                to adhere to the terms outlined in the agreement.</p>
            <p>Changes to the scope of work after the project has started may result in revised timelines and additional
                charges. All deliverables remain the property of OnClick Infotech until full payment is received unless
                otherwise agreed in writing.</p>

            <h2 id="policy-6">6. Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>For any paid service, clients are required to follow the payment terms specified in their project
                agreement or invoice. This may include advance payments, milestone-based billing, or full payment upon
                delivery.</p>
            <p>Failure to make payments as agreed may result in suspension of services, delay in deliverables, or
                termination of the contract. In case of overdue payments, we reserve the right to charge late fees or
                initiate legal recovery if necessary.</p>

            <h2 id="policy-7">7. Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>We understand the importance of privacy in business relationships. Any sensitive or proprietary
                information shared with us during the course of a project—such as business models, client data, or
                internal processes—will be treated with strict confidentiality. Similarly, we ask that clients respect
                the confidentiality of any internal documents or intellectual property shared by us during a project.
            </p>

            <h2 id="policy-8">8. Third-Party Tools and Services</h2>
            <p>Some of our services may involve the use of third-party tools, APIs, frameworks, plugins, or hosting
                platforms. While we do our best to select reliable providers, OnClick Infotech is not responsible for
                the functionality, uptime, data handling, or pricing of third-party services. Any issues related to
                these services should be addressed with the respective third-party provider.</p>

            <h2 id="policy-9">9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>While we strive to provide professional, error-free, and timely services, OnClick Infotech shall not be
                held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use of our
                services, website, or inability to use the same. This includes, but is not limited to, data loss,
                business disruption, or unforeseen technical issues.</p>
            <p>Our total liability under any circumstance will be limited to the amount paid by you for the specific
                service in question.</p>

            <h2 id="policy-10">10. Termination</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any ongoing service or project, at our sole discretion, in
                cases where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The client violates any of these terms;</li>
                <li>Payment obligations are not met;</li>
                <li>There is misuse of our services or intellectual property;</li>
                <li>There is abusive or inappropriate communication.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Upon termination, any outstanding balances become immediately due, and the client is required to cease
                use of any unpaid-for work or materials provided.</p>

            <h2 id="policy-11">11. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms of Service shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of [Your
                State/Country]. Any disputes arising from or related to the use of our services will be subject to the
                jurisdiction of the courts located in [Your Jurisdiction].</p>

            <h2 id="policy-12">12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms of Service at any time, without prior notice. Any
                changes will take effect immediately upon being posted on this page. We encourage you to review this
                section regularly to stay informed about your rights and obligations.</p>
